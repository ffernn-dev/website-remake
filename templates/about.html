<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Getting up close and personal ðŸ˜³</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>
  I'm
  <span id="age"><noscript>17</noscript></span>
  years old and I was born and live in Australia. I love making things! I do a
  little bit of everything (go check out my portfolio page next) but here's a
  vague list of my hobbies:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Software development, including
    <ul>
      <li>Web development</li>
      <li>Game development</li>
      <li>Embedded programming</li>
      <li>Bash scripting to pretend like I'm saving time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    I love music production but don't do it very often, although I've recently
    joined a rock band with some friends so keep an eye out for that maybe??
  </li>
  <li>
    I had a phase of doing heaps of 3D modelling, VFX and architecture renders
    which I had great fun with, but haven't done in a while.
  </li>
  <li>
    More recently (as of Dec 2024) I've been doing a lot of electronics such as
    microcontroller/LED strip projects, and a school assignment in which we
    build a hexapod from a kit and programmed it with inverse kinematics!
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Pronouns?</h2>
<p>
  Quick answer: whatever you want! People often use he/him though as I was born
  male.
</p>
<p>
  Long answer: I love all pronouns and don't mind which people use for me.
  Basically just call me whatever you feel like! If you're not sure, he/him is
  fine. For more information check out my

    >pronouns.page</a
  >.
</p>
<h2>Gender Identity</h2>
<p>
  I identify as genderfluid, which means my gender isn't fixed. Sometimes I feel
  more male, sometimes female, sometimes both or neither.

    >WebMD has an alright article</a
  >
  that explains things a bit better than I can, but then again it's not super
  complicated and as I said, I don't mind how you see my gender or how you refer
  to me. After all I'm just some guy :p
