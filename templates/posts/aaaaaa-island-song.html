<p>A cover of Island Song (the Adventure Time credits track) by Ashley Eriksson that I helped arrange and produced. A few of my internet friends and I got together to make this, with <a href="https://bucketfish.me/" class="url inlineurl">bucketfish</a> doing vocals, guitar and kalimba and John doing bass vocals and most of the arrangement.<br>
My production experience is very limited but I applied some techniques I learned online to pan, EQ and balance to create what I think is a pretty decent result!</p>{% endblock %}
