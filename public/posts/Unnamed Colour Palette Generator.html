<p>A work in progress colour palette generator inspired byÂ <a href="https://coolors.co/">coolors.co</a> in light of most of their features being paywalled. Hit spacebar to generate palette of complementary colours.</p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li>More colour wheel generation methods (split complementary, triadic, etc.)</li>
<li>Support more/less than 4 colours.</li>
<li>Colour input and "locking" to generate palettes around existing colours.</li>
</ul>
