<h2>Update 2024:</h2>
<p>This game was a collaborative project with my great friend the amazing <a href="https://bucketfish.me">bucketfish</a>!! It was our team entry for Ludum Dare 50, and we had a great time experimenting with the mixed 2D-3D art style :)</p>
<h2>Original Description</h2>
<p>There are three inevitable things in life: death, taxes, and <strong>homework</strong>.
<strong>The web version has limited graphics to run better in browsers. Please use the desktop builds where possible.</strong><br>
You are but a little guy with a deadline. But the world is such a fun place! There are various things to do, and homework isn’t really <em>that</em> important anyway.
Procrastinate as much as you can, but watch out for your parents — they will pressure you to do work faster if they catch you lazing around. Watch the clock carefully for their arrival!
All the best, little rebel.</p>
