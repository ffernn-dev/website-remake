| I wasn't journalling this part so I don't have dates :( | Setting up dev environment, collating my projects to use as content, creating database schema, writing the build script to:<br>- Read metadata from the Markdown documents and store it in the database<br>- Create tags in the database and link them to posts in a many-to-many linking table<br>- Convert the Markdown content to HTML<br>- Optimise images referenced in the documents, and store a very low-res blurred representation in the database to show while it loads |
