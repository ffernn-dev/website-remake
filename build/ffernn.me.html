<p>I am currently in the process of remaking my personal site with a more dynamic project log/blogging system to act as a more complete portfolio. If you're seeing this page, I'm likely done! I'll do a technical writeup here when I'm done</p>
<h2>Old version:</h2>
<p>The first version of my personal website is no longer available online, but here was the original description:</p>
<p>Hi! I'm Fern (sometimes ffernn) and this is a lil site I put together to kinda collate a bunch of info about me and what I've done!
There's a navbar to the left to get around and a theme switcher at the bottom for those who prefer light mode (or just want to see the cool colour change)
Some info about this site:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's pretty tiny, weighing in at just under 200kb</li>
<li>It gets a perfect Google Lighthouse score (well, almost. I get marked down for the layout shift due to hiding and showing content sections)</li>
<li>And it took me probably 3 weeks on and off to make</li>
<li>Oh and I think some regulation says that I need to let you know I use 1 cookie to store what theme you prefer for next time :></li>
</ul>
