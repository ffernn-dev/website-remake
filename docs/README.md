# INTRODUCTION TO FLASK AND PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS TUTORIAL

This guided tutorial will introduce HSC Software Engineering to the basics of developing websites with the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). The tutorial has been specifically designed for requirements in the [NESA Software Engineering Syllabus](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/tas/software-engineering-11-12-2022/content/n12/fa6aab137e) and for students in NSW Department of Education schools using eT4L computers.

## Overview of Progressive Web Apps

A [Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps?ref=arctype.com) is an app that is built using web platform technologies, but that provides a user experience like that of a platform-specific app. Like a website, a PWA can run on multiple platforms and devices from a single codebase. Like a platform-specific app, it can be installed on the device, can operate while offline and in the background, and can integrate with the device and with other installed apps.

### Technical features of PWAs

Because PWAs are websites, they have the same basic features as any other website: at least one HTML page, which loads CSS and JavaScript. Javascript is the language of the web and is exclusivly used for client side front end, python in the web context can only be used in the back end. Like a normal website, the JavaScript loaded by the page has a global Window object and can access all the Web APIs that are available through that object. The PWA standard as defined by [W3C Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/) has some specific features additonal to a website:

| Feature | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| manifest.json | A app manifest file, which, at a minimum, provides information that the operating system needs to install the PWA, such as the app name, screen orientation and icon set for different sized viewports. |
| serviceworker.js | A service worker, which, at a minimum, manages the caching that enables a online and offline experience whilst also interfacing with API's such as the [notification web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification). It's important to udnerstand that this JS file cannot control the DOM of the application. |
| icons & screanshots | A set of icons and screenshots that are used in when uploading to an app store and when installing it as a native application. It is these icons that will be used in the desktop or app launcher when installed. |
| Installable | Because of the information contained in the manifest.json all PWA's can be installed like a native app. They can also be packaged and uploaded to the Google, Microsoft & Apple app stores. |
| Cached locally | Because the service worker details all apps and pages to be cached (all pages must have a *.html name) the app and it's resources can be cached locally for quick load times. _Note backend apps where the web server serves all pages from the DNS root do not meet the PWA specification._ |

The below image illustrates how the servicework manages online and offline behaviour.

![A highlevel illustration of the service worker](/docs/README_resources/Progressive-Web-Apps-Architecture.png "The service worker handles the initial requests and sets the behaviour depending on if the app is on or offline.")

This screen capture shows how the final PWA will render to the user.

![Screen capture of the finished PWA](/docs/README_resources/final_app.png "This is what your application will look like")

## Requirements

1. VSCode
2. Python 3.x +
3. Node.js v.20.x +

## Prior learning

1. Bash basics & using the GIT Bash shell in VSCode
2. SQL
3. HTML Basics
4. CSS Basics
5. Python

## Open a GIT BASH terminal

> [!NOTE]
> From here in, you should aim to run all commands from the CLI. You are discouraged from left/right clicking the GUI. You will find it feels slow at first but through disciplined use, you will become much quicker and more accurate with CLI commands than GUI controls.

Make sure you open a new terminal with the keys <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> and choose Git Bash from the menu option in the top right of the terminal shell.

![Screen capture of the menu options for terminals](/docs/README_resources/git_bash_shell.png "Choose Git Bash from the list")

## STEPS TO BUILDING YOUR FIRST PWA

### Setup your environment

1. Common VScode settings are set in .vscode/settings.json and default plugins are in .devcontainer/devcontainer.json (devcontainer assumes you have the [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) installed.). Those with VSCode experience should adjust any settings to their preferences.

2. Get the working files which includes this README.md
    - Open a new window in VSCode
    - Choose your working directory
    - ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/TempeHS/NodeJS_PWA_Programming_For_The_Web_Task_Template.git
        cd NodeJS_PWA_Programming_For_The_Web_Task_Template
      ```

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively you can fork the [template repository](https://github.com/TempeHS/NodeJS_PWA_Programming_For_The_Web_Task_Template) to your own GitHub account and open it in a Codespace in which all dependencis and extensions will be automatically installed.

1. Inititalise a node application

```bash
    npm init -y
```

2. Install necessary depenencies.

```bash
    npm install sqlite3
    npm install express
```

3. Install specically required extensions for this tutorial.
   - [ms-vscode.js-debug-nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-debug-nightly)
   - [McCarter.start-git-bash](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=McCarter.start-git-bash)
   - [alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite)
   - [medo64.render-crlf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=medo64.render-crlf)

> [!TIP]
> Other extensions such as rainbow indentor and linting tools are also recommended to improve your IDE experience with VSCode.

### Create files and folders for your Flask Project

1. Files or folders that start with a dot (`\.*` or `.*.*`) can't be served by the webserver. This adds a layer of security for assets that you do not want to be public.

```bash
    touch .workingDocuments
```

2. Create a license file.

```bash
    touch LICENSE
    code LICENSE
```

Copy the [GNU GPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt) text into the file. GNU GPL is a free software license, or copyleft license, that guarantee end users the freedoms to run, study, share, and modify the software.
3. Create your directory structure and some base files using BASH scripts reading text files.

```text
    ├── .database
    ├── .workingdocuments
    ├── public
    │   ├── css
    │   ├── icons  
    │   ├── images  
    │   ├── js  
    │   ├── index.html
    │   ├── about.html    
    │   ├── manifest.json
    │   ├── serviceWorker.js  
    ├── LICENSE  
    └── index.js
```

3. Populate a text file with a list of folders you need in the public of your project. All contents of the public folder will be served by the webserver. This folder is the 'FRONT END' while all folders behind it are the 'BACK END'.

```bash
    mkdir public
    cd public
    touch folders.txt
    code folder.txt
```

4. Run a BASH script to read the text file and create the folders listed in it.

```bash
    while read -r line; do   
    echo $line  
    mkdir -p $line  
    done < folders.txt
```

5. Populate the file with a list of files you need in the root of your project.

```bash
    touch files.txt
    code files.txt
```

6. Run a BASH script to read the text file and create the files listed in it.

```bash
    while read -r line; do   
    echo $line  
    touch -p $line  
    done < files.txt\
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The last list item needs a line ending so make sure there is a blank last line in the file.
> - You will find that all file and folder names have an unwanted `space` character at the end. This is because you are using a BASH emulator on Windows operating system. Bash is a Unix language that uses [LF the unicode character 000A while Windows uses CRLF the Unicode characters 000D + 000A](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/encodings-and-line-breaks?view=vs-2022). Because you have installed the [medo64.render-crlf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=medo64.render-crlf) extension just click on `CRLF` in the bottom bar of VSCode and choose `LF` to change the line ending before running your BASH script.

### Setup your SQLite3 Database

```bash
    cd ..
    mkdir .database
    cd .database
    touch data_source.db
    touch my_queries.sql
    code my_queries.sql
```

> [!NOTE]
> The following SQL queries are provided as an example only, students are encouraged to select their own content and design a database schema for it, ideas include:
>
> - Favourate bands
> - Favourate movies
> - Favourate games
> - Favourate books
> - etc

1. Run SQL queries to setup your database table. When asked choose the database.db.

```sql
    CREATE TABLE extension(extID INTERGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,name TEXT NOT NULL, hyperlink TEXT NOT NULL,about TEXT NOT NULL,image TEXT NOT NULL,language TEXT NOT NULL);
```

2. After running each query put `--` infront of the query to turn it into a comment so it doesn't run again and error.
3. Run SQL queries to populate your table.

```sql
    INSERT INTO extension(extID,name,hyperlink,about,image,language) VALUES (1,"Live Server","https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer","Launch a development local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages","https://ritwickdey.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/ritwickdey/liveserver/5.7.9/1661914858952/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.Default","HTML CSS JS");
```

```sql
    INSERT INTO extension(extID,name,hyperlink,about,image,language) VALUES (2,"VSCode-SQLite","https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite","Explore and query SQLite databases.","https://alexcvzz.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/alexcvzz/vscode-sqlite/0.14.1/1654359416316/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.Default","SQL");
```

```sql
    INSERT INTO extension(extID,name,hyperlink,about,image,language) VALUES (3,"Render CR LF","https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=medo64.render-crlf","Displays the line ending symbol and optionally extra whitespace when 'Render whitespace' is turned on.","https://medo64.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/medo64/render-crlf/1.7.1/1689315206970/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.Default","#BASH");
```

```sql
    INSERT INTO extension(extID,name,hyperlink,about,image,language) VALUES (4,"Start GIT BASH","https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=McCarter.start-git-bash","Adds a bash command to VSCode that allows you to start git-bash in the current workspace's root folder.","https://mccarter.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/mccarter/start-git-bash/1.2.1/1499505567572/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.Default","#BASH");
```

4. Run some SQL queries to test your database.

```sql
    SELECT * FROM extension;
    SELECT * FROM extension WHERE language LIKE '#BASH';
```

### Make your graphic assets

1. Use Photoshop or [Canva](https://www.canva.com/en_au/signup/?signupRedirect=%2Fedu-signup&loginRedirect=%2Fedu-signup&brandingVariant=edu) to design a simple square logo 1080px X 1080px named logo.png. Save all working files into the .workingdocuments directory.
2. Design simplified app icon 512px X 512px names favicon.png.
3. Web optimise the images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).
4. Save the files into the public/images folder.
5. Rename the 512x512 icon to icon-512x512.png then resize and rename it as follows:
   - icon-128x128.png
   - icon-192x192.png
   - icon-384x384.png
   - icon-512x512.png
6. Web optimise the images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) and save them into the public/icons.

> [!NOTE]
> Graphic design is not the focus of this course, you should not spend excessive time designing logos and icons.

### Setup your core index.html

> [!NOTE]
> Adjust titles, headings and content to match your concept.

```bash
    cd ../templates
    touch layout.html
    code layout.html
```

5. Insert the basic HTML struture in your index.html file.

```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self';">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" />
        <title>VSCode Extension Catalogue</title>
        <link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json" />
        <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="images/favicon.png">
    </head>
    <body>
        <main>
            <!-- NAV START -->

            <!-- NAV END -->            
            <div class="container">
            </div>
        </main>
        <script src="js/app.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
```

---

### Style the HTML core

```bash
    cd css
    touch style.css
    code style.css
```

1. Insert the css code into css/style.css.

```css
    @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito:400,700&display=swap");
    * {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    body {
        background: #fdfdfd;
        font-family: "Nunito", sans-serif;
        font-size: 1rem;
    }
    main {
        max-width: 900px;
        margin: auto;
        padding: 0.5rem;
        text-align: center;
    }
```

---

### Make and style the menu

```bash
    cd ..
    code index.html
```

1. Insert the menu HTML into index.html between the comment placeholders.

```html
    <nav>
        <img src="images\logo.png" alt="VSCode Extensions site logo." />
        <h1>VSCode Extensions</h1>
        <ul class="topnav">
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="add.html">Add me</a></li>
            <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav> 
```

```bash
    `cd ../../public/css`  
    `code style.css`
```  

2. Style the menu by inserting this below your existing CSS in public/css/style.css.

```css
    nav {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between;
        align-items: center;
    }
    nav img {
        height:100px;
    }
    nav ul {
        list-style: none;
        display: flex;
    }
    nav li {
        margin-right: 1rem;
    }
    nav ul li a {
        text-decoration-line:none;
        text-transform: uppercase; 
        color: #393b45;
    }
    nav ul li a:hover {
        color: #14E6DD;
    }
    nav h1 {
        color: #106D69;
        margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    }
```

### Render your website
Express is a light weight webserver designed specifically for Node.js web applications. You have already installed it when you set up your environment.

```bash
    cd ../..
    code index.js
```

1. Insert the node.js to the backend index.js.

```js
    // Insert additional backend js above the express server configuration

    const express = require("express");
    const path = require("path");
    const app = express();
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));
    
    app.get("/", function (req, res) {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "public/index.html"));
    });
    app.listen(80, () => console.log("Server is running on Port 80, visit http://localhost:80/ or http://127.0.0.1:80 to access your website") );
```

2. Run the builtin webserver.

```bash
    node index.js
```

3. Visit your website and look at the souce in developer tools to see how the page has rendered.

### Query your SQL database and migrate the data for the frontend

>[!NOTE]
> From here students have two choices, they can use their existing Python skills or new JS skills. Either way students will be querying a table in data_source.db and then constructing a JSON file that will be pushed to the frontend ready for rending by a frontend JS script.
> If you choose the JS method, you may want to refer to the Python method in the future as a helpful way to have more complex Python programs in the backend and create a simple responsive GUI using HTML/CSS/JS.

#### Why JSON?
[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is also very secure and the worflow used in this application ensures data integrity of the backend.

### Choose your backend implementaion language:

<details>
    <summary><h3 style="display:inline">I want to use Python</h3></summary>

1. Install the Python SQLite3 requirements

    ```bash
    pip install sqlite3
    ```

    ```bash
    touch database_manager.py
    code database_manager.py
    ```

2. Write the Python Script to query the SQL database and construct the JSON file.

    ```python
    import sqlite3 as sql

    con = sql.connect(".database/data_source.db")
    cur = con.cursor()
    data = cur.execute('SELECT * FROM extension').fetchall()
    con.close()
    f = open("public/frontEndData.json", "w")
    f.write("[\n")
    for row in data:
        f.write('{\n')
        f.write(f'"extID":{row[0]},\n"name":"{row[1]}",\n"hyperlink":"{row[2]}",\n"about":"{row[3]}",\n"image":"{row[4]}",\n"language":"{row[5]}"\n')
        if row == data[len(data)-1]:
            f.write("}\n")
        else:
            f.write("},\n")
    f.write("]\n")
    f.close()

    ```

>[!NOTE]
> This approach is different from the Pythonic way to generate a JSON file. Because this approach is about algorithm design, it models how an algorithm can easily migrate data from one format/structure to another. If you know the Pythonic way feel free to implement it. However, software engineers should understand and be able to replicate data migration algoriythms.

    ```bash
    code index.js
    ```

2. Insert this js above the express setup in index.js to run the Python program.

    ```js
    const spawn = require("child_process").spawn;
    // you can add arguments with spawn('python',["path/to/script.py", arg1, arg2, ...])
    const pythonProcess = spawn('python',["database_manager.py"]);
    ```

3. Test your application. The expected behaviour is a file called frontEndData.json filled with the table from data_source is saved in the /public folder. The JSON file should validate with [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/).

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h3 style="display:inline">I want to use JavaScript</h3></summary>
  
    ```bash
    code index.js
    ```

1. Write the Python Script to query the SQL database and construct the JSON file.

    ```js
    const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();
    const db = new sqlite3.Database('.database/data_source.db');

    let myString = '[\n';
    db.all("SELECT * FROM extension", function(err, rows) {
        let myCounter = 0;
        rows.forEach(function (row) {
        // for debugging
        // console.log(row.extID + ": " + row.name + ": " + row.hyperlink + ": " + row.about + ": " + row.image + ": " + row.language);  
        myString = myString + '{\n"extID":' + row.extID + ',\n"name":"' + row.name + '",\n"hyperlink":"' + row.hyperlink + '",\n"about":"' + row.about + '",\n"image":"' + row.image + '",\n"language":"' + row.language;
        myCounter++;
        if (myCounter == rows.length) {
            myString = myString + '"\n}\n';
        } else {
            myString = myString + '"\n},\n';
        }
    });

    // console.log(myString);
    var fs = require('fs');
    fs.writeFile("public/frontEndData.json", myString + "]", function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
        }
    });
    });
    ```

3. Test your application. The expected behaviour is a file called frontEndData.json filled with the table from data_source is saved in the /public folder. The JSON file should validate with [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/).

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

</details>

### Render the JSON data on the frontend

    ```bash
    cd public/js
    touch app.js
    code app.js
    ```

1. Insert the js into public/js/app.js, this js reads the JSON file and inserts it as HTML into the .container class `<DIV>`.
    ```js
    let result = "";
    fetch('./frontEndData.json')
    .then(function (response) {
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(function (data) {
        appendData(data);
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
        console.log('error: ' + err);
    });
    function appendData(data) {
        data.forEach(({ name, image, hyperlink, about, language } = rows) => {
        result += `
            <div class="card">
            <img class="card-image" src="${image}" alt="Product image for the ${name} VSCode extension."/>
            <h1 class="card-name">${name}</h1>
            <p class="card-about">${about}</p>
            <a class="card-link" href="${hyperlink}"><button class="btn">Read More</button></a>
            </div>
            `;
        });
    document.querySelector(".container").innerHTML = result;
    }
    ```

```bash
    cd ../css
    code style.css
```

2. Style the cards by inserting this below your existing CSS in public/css/style.css.

```css
    .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(15rem, 1fr));
        grid-gap: 1rem;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        margin: auto;
        padding: 1rem 0;
    }
    .card {
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        flex-direction: column;
        width: 17rem;
        background: #fff;
        box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23);
        border-radius: 10px;
        margin: auto;
        overflow: hidden;
    }
    .card-image {
        width: 100%;
        height: 15rem;
        object-fit: cover;
    }
    .card-name {
        color: #222;
        font-weight: 700;
        text-transform: capitalize;
        font-size: 1.1rem;
        margin-top: 0.5rem;
    }
    .card-about {
        text-overflow: ellipsis;
        width: 15rem;
        white-space: nowrap;
        overflow: hidden;
        margin-bottom:1rem;
    }
    .btn {
        border:none;

### Finish the PWA code so it is compliant to W3 web standards

1. Take a screen shot of the website. Then size the image to 1080px X 1920px, web optimise the images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) and save it to public/icons.

```bash
    cd ..
    code manifest.json
```

2. Configure the manifest.json to the PWA standard by inserting the json below and validating the json with [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/). The manifest.json sets the configuration for the installtion and caching of the PWA.

```json
    {
        "name": "VSCode Extension Catalogue",

        "background_color": "#fdfdfd",
        "theme_color": "#14E6DD",
        "orientation": "landscape-primary",
        "icons": [
        {

            "type": "image/png",
            "sizes": "128x128",
            "purpose": "any"
        },
        {
            "src": "icons/icon-192x192.png",
            "type": "image/png",
            "sizes": "192x192",
            "purpose": "maskable"
        },
        {

            "type": "image/png",
            "sizes": "192x192",
            "purpose": "any"
        },
        {
            "src": "icons/icon-384x384.png",
            "type": "image/png",
            "sizes": "384x384",
            "purpose": "maskable"
        },
        {
            "src": "icons/icon-384x384.png",
            "type": "image/png",
            "sizes": "384x384",
            "purpose": "any"
        },
        {

            "type": "image/png",
            "sizes": "512x512",
            "purpose": "maskable"
        },
        {
            "src": "icons/icon-512x512.png",
            "type": "image/png",
            "sizes": "512x512",
            "purpose": "any"
        }
        ],
        "screenshots" : [
        {
        "src": "icons/desktop_screenshot.png",
        "sizes": "1920x1080",
        "type": "image/png",
        "label": ""
        },
        {
        "src": "icons/mobile_screenshot.png",
        "sizes": "1080x1920",
        "type": "image/png",
        "form_factor": "wide",
        "label": ""
        }
    ]
    }
```

```bash
    cd js
    code ap.js
```

2. Configure the app.js to initiate the servicework.js ny inserting the JS. This ensures that when the window (app) loads that the serviceworker.js is called to memory.

```js
    if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
        window.addEventListener("load", function () {
        navigator.serviceWorker
            .register("js/serviceWorker.js")
            .then((res) => console.log("service worker registered"))
            .catch((err) => console.log("service worker not registered", err));
        });
    }
```

```bash
    cd js
    code serviceworker.js
```

1. Configure the serviceworker.js by inserting the JS. The servicworker.js as the same suggest is the file that does all the work in a PWA including cacheing and API intergration for the [WEB API's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).

```js
const assets = [
        "/",
        "css/style.css",
        "js/app.js",
        "images/logo.png",
        "images/favicon.jpg",
        "icons/icon-128x128.png",
        "icons/icon-192x192.png",
        "icons/icon-384x384.png",
        "icons/icon-512x512.png",
        "icons/desktop_screenshot.png",
        "icons/mobile_screenshot.png"
    ];

    const CATALOGUE_ASSETS = "catalogue-assets";

    self.addEventListener("install", (installEvt) => {
    installEvt.waitUntil(
        caches
        .open(CATALOGUE_ASSETS)
        .then((cache) => {
            console.log(cache)
            cache.addAll(assets);
        })
        .then(self.skipWaiting())
        .catch((e) => {
            console.log(e);
        })
    );
    });

    self.addEventListener("activate", function (evt) {
    evt.waitUntil(
        caches
        .keys()
        .then((keyList) => {
            return Promise.all(
            keyList.map((key) => {
                if (key === CATALOGUE_ASSETS) {
                console.log("Removed old cache from", key);
                return caches.delete(key);
                }
            })
            );
        })
        .then(() => self.clients.claim())
    );
    });

    self.addEventListener("fetch", function (evt) {
    evt.respondWith(
        fetch(evt.request).catch(() => {
        return caches.open(CATALOGUE_ASSETS).then((cache) => {
            return cache.match(evt.request);
        });
        })
    );
    })
```

### Validate your PWA
Validation is important to ensure the app is compliant to [W3 web standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/).
1. Open your website in Chrome and open developer tools (F12), run a Lighthouse report.
![Screen cpature of Chrome Lighthouse report](/docs/README_resources/Chrome_Lighthouse_Report.png "Click F12 and choose Lighthouse on the top menu of your developer tools").
2. Open your website in Edge and open developer tools (F12), look at the application report.
![Screen cpature of Chrome Lighthouse report](/docs/README_resources/Edge_Application_Report.png "Click F12 and choose Lighthouse on the top menu of your developer tools").

### Take your app further
The following code snippets will help you create a simple form in the add.html page. This form is for people to add their details to an email database for updates on your catalogue. Less explict instructions have been provided, students are encouraged to practice their BASH, SQL, HTML, CSS & JS to bring it all together. The screen shot below is what the page should like like and when users submit the database is updated.

![Screen capture of the finished PWA](/docs/README_resources/form_example.png "This is what your application will look like").

1. Page specifications:
    - Simple form where the user inserts their name and email address
    - When they click submit the data base is updated
    - The input form must be styled to be consistent with the rest of the website
    - A message confirming submission is returned to the user
2. SQL schema specifications:
    - A new table called contact_list
    - 3 columns
      - id is the primary key and should increment automatically
      - email must be unique
      - name

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to catch the expection of a duplicate email

```bash
    npm npm install body-parser
```

```js
    let bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));
```

```js
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname,'.public/add.html'));
```

```js
    app.post('/add.html', function(req,res){
    db.serialize(()=>{
        db.run('INSERT INTO contact_list(email,name) VALUES(?,?)', [req.body.email, req.body.name], function(err) {
            if (err) {
                return console.log(err.message);
            }
            res.send("Thank you "+req.body.name+" we have added your email "+req.body.email+" to our distribution list.");
        });
    });
    });
```

```html
    <form action="/app.html" method="POST" class="box">
      <div>
        <label class="form-label">Email address</label>
        <input name="email" type="email" class="form-control" id="email" pattern="[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2, 4}$" placeholder="name@example.com">
      </div>
      <div>
        <label class="form-label">Name</label>
        <textarea class="form-control" name="name" id="name" rows="1"></textarea>
      </div>
      <br/>
      <div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn">Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>
```

```css
    .form-control {

    }
```
