## Update 2024:
My second game jam project, this one made for Ludum Dare 49. 

## Original Description
A small game about letters and words.  

Click letters to drop them, Holding mouse1 makes your mouse push the letters, Clear all the letters off the screen (throw them out the top or other methods). Thanks for playing!
