**Weekary** is a simple weekly planner I made to help me with blocking out the regular weekly events I have to better visualise my time. Some things that I'm proud of are the autosave that waits for you to stop typing before saving, the visual theme, and the popup colour picker. It works pretty well as is, but I switched to using Apple Calendar primarily instead, so there are some missing features that I'd hoped to implement at some point but never got around to:
- Customising the time blocks to allow for things like half-hourly schedules, or custom day start/end times
- Data export/import to move between devices
- Improve the colour picker to allow "painting" i.e. colouring many blocks by clicking and dragging over them.
