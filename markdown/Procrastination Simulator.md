## Update 2024:
This game was a collaborative project with my great friend the amazing [bucketfish](https://bucketfish.me)!! It was our team entry for Ludum Dare 50, and we had a great time experimenting with the mixed 2D-3D art style :)

## Original Description
There are three inevitable things in life: death, taxes, and **homework**.
**The web version has limited graphics to run better in browsers. Please use the desktop builds where possible.**  
You are but a little guy with a deadline. But the world is such a fun place! There are various things to do, and homework isn’t really _that_ important anyway.
Procrastinate as much as you can, but watch out for your parents — they will pressure you to do work faster if they catch you lazing around. Watch the clock carefully for their arrival!
All the best, little rebel.
