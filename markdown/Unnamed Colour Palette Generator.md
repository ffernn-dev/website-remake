A work in progress colour palette generator inspired byÂ [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) in light of most of their features being paywalled. Hit spacebar to generate palette of complementary colours.
## Roadmap
- More colour wheel generation methods (split complementary, triadic, etc.)
- Support more/less than 4 colours.
- Colour input and "locking" to generate palettes around existing colours.
