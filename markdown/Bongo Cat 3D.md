A small Bongo cat simulator that I 3d modelled and programmed for a friend as a Secret Santa gift.
It's really not very polished but it's the best I would do in the time frame and I hope you enjoy it!
**merry crhistmes!!**
## Controlos:
Left side of keyboard or left mouse for left bongo
Right side of keyboard or right mouse for right bongo
Shift, Space or Enter for meows
## NOTICE:
### After issues with the game crashing whole browsers (???) I have removed the web version for now.
