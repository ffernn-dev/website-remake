## 2024 update:
This was my first foray into game development using the Godot engine. I'd had experience making small scratch games, but I was teaching myself Godot and saw an ad for the Stop Waiting For Godot game jam so decided to try my hand at making a game in a weekend. Needless to say it's not amazing, but I learned a lot about object oriented game design, time management and how to stay within scope.
## Original description:
A very basic platformer for the STOP WAITING FOR GODOT Game jam. It's very lacking at the moment, but this is my first time making a proper game. I may or may not build on it in the future, but give me any feedback in the comments.
**IMPORTANT:** Dashing upwards is broken so make sure to press z _before_ you press jump!  
I will be making a video of the process soon-ish, so keep an eye on my channel:
